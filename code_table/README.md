## How to generate the "pan_to_peptide.tsv" code file

The file `code_table/pan_to_peptide.tsv` is a hash/map between panIDs and semi-random peptide-like
sequences. This mapping is required by pandagma in the step `name_pangenes`,
and by the utility scripts `encode_annot_order.pl` and `decode_annot_order.pl`.

The file will be generated by `pandagma.sh` at the `name_pangenes` step if it doesn't already exist.
The file can also be generated manually like so:

```
  ./bin/make_peptide_hash.pl > code_table/pan_to_peptide.tsv
```
